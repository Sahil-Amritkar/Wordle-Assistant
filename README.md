# Wordle-Assistant
 A little helper for those who can't remember words  
This is just a fun code i decided to write one night. This is not a bot to crack the game or anything. I just wanted to make something that can suggest possible words to a user. It uses comparison based exclusion and a little probablity to suggest the best words to use.  
Hope you give it a try!  
You can also play past wordle games using this!    
  
For the Text based version:  
You will need to downlaod the following in a folder:  
- Wordle_Assistant_noGUI.py (Run this)
